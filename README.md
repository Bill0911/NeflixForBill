This is a Web Application for a Neflix Clone, with a backend API connection to our database.

The application needs to have the following to be able to run: 
1. You need to open this application through highly recommended Intellij with a JDK of 21 or the latest if you don't have this make sure to download it2. Intellij will ask you to load the maven which is required for use, so make sure to automatically add these dependencies.
2. You will need an environment as well to be able to access PHPmyadmin, and for this you are recommended to use Docker and the environment NHL Stenden provides.

Having done the following steps make sure you git clone inside the NHL folder and navigate inside app, and make a folder and git clone in public folder to be able to access the Web Appliccation.

Few Notes for starting the app:
1. To start app, go to the xml folder and run the NetflixApplication (If asked to download any dependencies for maven please do so.)
2. Make sure the apps inside the docker environment are all turned on so our API can connect to the server and database.

To access our DataBase, you would need to go to the resources folder where you can find the database url to the database as well as the username and password. Heads up there are two, one named main_api_user and the alternative one.
